1. Restart app
2. in the data.json, add mock data to test app
3. The next thing we need to do is test our ability to read a set of test data. Use useState() hook to wire up some local state in App.js.
4.  Map the toDoList and create individual todo components
5. Create two new files in the src directory called ToDoList.js and ToDo.js.
6. Let The ToDoList.js file be the container that holds all of our todos.
7.  ToDo.js is one single row in our To Do List.
8. In the ToDoList, we will map over the todoList object that was passed down as props to create individual todos.
9. All we want from the ToDo component is the actual task that is on our list. We will also need to make use of the complete property on the todo object to indicate whether or not something is decorated with a strikethrough.

10. Toggle task completion
